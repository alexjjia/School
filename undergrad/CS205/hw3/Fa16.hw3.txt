HOMEWORK 3
(Natural Deduction Proofs. Predicate Logic formulas, but no proofs.)

Due: Sunday, October 2nd, 5 AM


1.  Prove the following formally using a Natural Deduction proof that only
uses the inference rules on the handout that are on the lecture notes page.  
(Be sure not to use equivalence rules or Rosen inference rules.)
 
a) p /\ q |- p \/ r
b) p->~q , q |- ~p
c) p -> (q -> r) |- (p /\ q) -> r
d) ~q |- q -> p
e) p \/ (q /\ r) |- p \/ q



[For your own benefit, try Rosen-style proofs.  If there is a Rosen
inference rule or equivalence corresponding to what you are trying to prove
_do not use it_ -- only use _other_ rules.  DO NOT HAND THESE IN]

2*. Give  Natural Deduction proofs of the following (the proofs are
much more challenging)
 
a)    A \/ B, ~B \/ C |- A \/ C

b)   A -> B |- ~B -> ~A  [optional bonus]
