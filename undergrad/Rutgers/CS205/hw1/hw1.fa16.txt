>>Sec. 2.1
(i) For each of the following sets, determine whether 9 is an element of
that set (answer with Y or N).
 (a) {9, 9}
 (b) {{{9}}, {9}}
 (c) {9, {9}}
 (d) {{{9}}}

(ii) For each of the above sets, determine whether {9} is a subset of
that set (answer with Y or N).

(iii) What is Powerset(Powerset(S)) for S={a,b}

(iv) For each of the following indicate (Yes or No) whether
   it is the power set of some other set S, and if yes, give S:
  a) { {} , {2} }
  b) {}
  c) { {} , {2} , { {},2 } }

>> Sec. 2.2:
The proofs of set equality below should NOT use set identities (which were
not covered in lecture)
(iv)  Let A, B and C be sets.
    (a) Prove (A - B) - C is a subset of (A - C)
    (b) A union (B - A) = A union B

(v)  Let A, B and C be sets. In which of the following cases can you
conclude that A = B
    (a) A union C = B union C
    (b) A intersect C = B intersect C
    (c) both (a) and (b) above

(vi)  Define the symmetric difference of sets A and B (written as  A [+] B
here), to be the set of elements which are in either A or B but not in
both.
a) What is {b,g,k,m} [+] {a,g,m} ?
b) What can you say about sets A and B that are subsets of universal set
   U,    if  A [+] B = U ?
c)* Determine if  A [+] (B [+] C) = (A [+] B) [+] C either by giving the
 smallest counter-example, or by giving a proof.


BONUS: State and prove a theorem which captures the intuition that the order
of elements in a set is not relevant. (First express the intuition that _duplicates_
do not matter by considering the pseudo-math pattern {...,b,...,b,...}, and then
state this as a slightly different theorem than the one in the class/notes; now
repeat for _order_)
