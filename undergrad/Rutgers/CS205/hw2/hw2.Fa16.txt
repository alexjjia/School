HOMEWORK 2
Due September 25, 5 a.m. (Saturday-to-Sunday night, like last time)

Please submit thru Sakai and check afterwards that your submission is
indeed there.  Also, please remember that attachments that are not pdf or
text files, or are not readable will not be graded.


>>Section 1.1

(1) Indicate whether each of the following is true or false
    (a)  if {7}={8} then 1+1=3
    (b)  if 1+2=3 then dogs can fly
    (c)  3+3=5 if and only if 1+2=3 

(2) Using letters for simple statements, translate the following compound 
  English statements into propositional logic formulas

    (a) If Jan wins or if he loses, he will be tired.

	(b) If prices go up, then housing will be plentiful and expensive; but
	if housing is not expensive then it will be plentiful.

	(c) Either going to bed or going swimming is sufficient condition for
	changing clothes.; however changing clothes does not mean going
	swimming.


>> Sections 1.1,1.3

3. MOTIVATION: Recal the problem about expressing in Propositional Logic the
following sentences: 

	"If Michelle wins she will be admired and become rich.  Otherwise, she
	will be ignored."

We had agreed that the individual sentences could be encoded as 'w ->
(a/\r)' and '~w -> i'.  When I took a poll of the class, a large majority
felt that they should be combined as a disjunction: 
        (w -> (a/\r)) \/ (~w ->i)
rather than as a conjunction:
        (w -> (a/\r)) /\ (~w -> i).

Let's explore using the tools of logic to see what happens.  First, since
the issue is conjunction vs disjunction at the top level, lets eliminate
the proposition fragment '/\r', thus reducing it from having 4 atomic
symbols to 3 (hence the truth table having 8 rather than 16 rows).

So here are the questions: 

Let P be the propositional formula (w -> a) \/ (~w -> i), and let Q be the 
propositional formula (w -> a) /\ (~w -> i).

(a) Construct the truth table terminating with columns for P and for Q.

(b) Which formula among P, or Q, is a tautology?

(c) Prove in a second way that the formula you selected in part (b) is
  tautology, by using an algebraic proof which shows that it is logically
  equivalent to True.  You can use _only_ equivalence rules in Figure 6
  (page 26) of Section 1.3 (also appearing in my notes).  Please be sure to
  use the proper format, where you justify each line by a rule.

(d) Take the formula that was NOT a tatology (according to what you said 
in (b) above), and
  
	(i) put it into "disjunctive normal form", starting with the
	distributive laws.  *Make the result be as short as possible (have as
	few symbols as possible).  Again, please show your derivation of normal
	DNF using an algebraic proof, as in part (c).  /* This is easy */

    (ii) Give a truth assignment to the symbols {w,a,i} which makes the
    non-tautology be false. (That is how you can tell it is not a 
    tautology)

[For your own intuition, no grade: Take the result of part (iv) and expand
the single letters {w,a,i} into the phrases {'M wins', 'M is admired', 'M
is ignored'} so you can read outloud the result.  The resulting conjuncts
represent the possible alternative states of the world represented by the
original formula.]

(e) Now consider the new formula Y = '(w -> r) /\ (~w -> ~r)'.  Just like
  in (d(i)), use algebraic equivalences to put it into DNF, and simplify it.
  /* Again, this is easy. It might explain the intuition that led the
     class to vote for disjunction.  */

-------------
(4) The NOR operator is defined as: (p NOR q) is true if and only if both
  p and q are false.  Show that {NOR} is _functionally complete_.  (I have
  done in class the case of the NAND operator.)

III. Section 1.6 (up to 'Resolution')

Recall that a "Rosen-style proof" (ones used in the text), uses Rosen
inference rules in Sec 1.6 (Table 1, {page 72}), together with Rosen's
equivalences (Table 6, {page 27}, plus the definition of -> and <->).  

(5) Give Rosen-style proofs for the following (you must use at least one
  rule of inference).

 (i)   p/\q |- p\/q
 (ii)  ~p   |- (p -> q)
 (iii)  ((b /\ c) -> (p /\ q)) |- ((b /\ c) -> p)
