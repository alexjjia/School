Section 1.5

A. Prove using the rules of propositional and predicate equivalence from 
Rosen that the following equivalences hold. Be sure to do a precise formal 
proof, with lines justified by equivalence rule names.

(1) Forall x. P(x)   \/  Exists x. ~P(x)   ==  True

(2)  Exists x. P(x)  ==  ~ Forall x. ~ P(x)

B. Express the _negation_ of each of the following formulas so that all 
negation symbols appear only immediately before predicates:

(1) Exist x. Exist y. P(x,y)   \/   Forall x. Forall z. Q(x,z)

(2) Exist x. Exist y.( Q(x,y)  <->  Q(y,x) )

Section 1.6 


C. For each of the following claims

* either prove they are true using rules of inference of the predicate
calculus: you may use either Rosen or NatDedn _propositional_ reasoning
rules, and the Rosen quantifiers rules in Table 6, augmented with my
restrictions on constant symbols (see handout on inference rules).

* or provide a counter-example, by defining appropriate predicate atoms
(e.g., {likes(bob,eve),..} in my updated lecture notes); for full credit,
use the smallest possible universe for the quantifiers.  

[Hint: think first about what the statements say _intuitively_, maybe using
something familiar instead of predicates P and Q.]


a) Exists y.(P(y) /\ Q(y)) |- Exists x.P(x) /\ Exists y.Q(y)

b) Exists y.(P(y) \/ Q(y)) |- Exists x.P(x) /\ Exists x.Q(x)

c)  Forall x.P(x) /\ Forall y.Q(y)  |- Forall z.(P(z) \/ Q(z))

d)  BONUS (hard): Prove    Exist x.(P(x) /\ Q(x)) |- Exists x.P(x) 
    using only the rules of Forall-INTRO and Forall-ELIM, plus the 
    equivalence Exists y.R(y)= ~ Forall y.( ~R(y)), as well as the
    rules of propositional natural deduction. (i.e., you are not
    allowed to use rules for Exists, because it is only an abbreviation.)

(i.e., The result to be proven is
   ~ Forall x. ~(P(x) /\ Q(x)) |- ~ Forall  x. ~P(x)
)
